# Obsidian PDF export layout
_In Shadowdark style_

I do most of my session preperation for D&D or shadowdark in obisidan.
This is a CSS snippet for the print layout of obsidian. This way it is styled in the very nice and simple monochrome style of shadowdark.

## Installation

Open Obsidian Settings -> Appearance -> CSS Snippets. Click on the small folder icon which opens the snippet location.
Drag either the `single-column-print.css` or `two-column-print.css` into that folder. Click on the reload icon and enable the snippet.

Now if you export a page as PDF it will use the snippet.
